1. Degree Heuristic (Œ±=0): Selects nodes with the largest out-degree, assuming nodes with more outgoing connections are the most influential.
    
2. Degree Heuristic (ùõº‚â†0): Selects nodes based on their out-degree and an Œ±-weighted in-degree, emphasizing both spreading potential and incoming pressure.
    -almost always worse than a=0

3. Degree Discount Heuristic (Œ±=0): Adjusts node scores by reducing the influence of neighbors already selected, avoiding redundant influence overlap.

4. Degree Discount Heuristic (ùõº‚â†0): Balances out-degree, selected neighbors, and Œ±-weighted in-degree, combining spread efficiency and incoming influence in a pressure-aware way.
    -almost always worse than a=0
    
5. Two-Step Pressure Heuristic: First pre-selects 5k nodes with the highest out-degree, then narrows to k nodes with the highest in-bound weight sum, ensuring a balance between spread and pressure.

6. Pressure Flow Heuristic: Ranks nodes based on the product of their total incoming pressure and out-degree, prioritizing nodes that can convert pressure into widespread influence.
    -may be better in denser graph

7. Amplified Coverage Heuristic: Combines out-degree with the Œ±-amplified in-degrees of neighbors, favoring nodes surrounded by influential connections.
    -most promising

8. Pressure Degree Discount Heuristic: Integrates degree discounting with Œ±-weighted in-degree pressure, dynamically adjusting scores to account for selected neighbors and incoming influence.
    -not good

9. Adaptive Combined Heuristic: Combines degree, degree discount, and pressure-based influence dynamically using tunable weights, providing a flexible approach for balancing spread and pressure.

10. Local Pressure Heuristic: Adds Œ±-scaled in-degrees of neighbors to a node‚Äôs degree, emphasizing local influence dynamics in addition to spreading potential.
    -may be better in denser graph

11. Hybrid Degree Heuristic: Multiplies a node‚Äôs out-degree by 1+Œ±‚ãÖin_degree, combining outgoing connections with incoming pressure in a multiplicative fashion.
    -may be better in denser graph

12. Adjusted Degree Discount Heuristic: Discounts the scores of nodes based on selected neighbors while boosting the influence of Œ±-weighted in-degree, combining spread reduction with pressure awareness.
