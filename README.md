1. Comparison of heuristics (using influence and true influence), all heuristics listed in /data/resultsheuristic.txt

2. Basic demonstration of PLT on a small graph compared to LT

3. Run various IM algs on PLT and LT and compare outputs
    a. Greedy
    b. CELF++

4. Test greedy on LT and PT and see if they select same seeds

5. Types of graphs to test (try for all experiments)
    a. Random graphs (current)
    b. Graph with nodes w/ more parents than children on average
    c. Louvaine sample of Facebook graph
    d. stochastic block model
